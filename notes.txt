in the linear probing if a collision exist we move it to another array by 1;
in comparison to the chaining implementation, where on each array
it contains a linkedlist whether it null or not transferring. if it has the
same hashkey means the same array index in this situation, it will look
first to the value of its key, if it is not the same then it will go to the next
until it hit a non-null element on which it will place its value and key;

update:
in this section the collision will exist given the fact that it has different key but
the same generated hash value, thereby it must return the key with the same value;
